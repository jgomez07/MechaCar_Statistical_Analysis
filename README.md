### Linear Regressioon to Predict Miles Per Gallon 

The resulting coefficients were non-random varience miles per gallon values such as ground clearance and vehicle length. 
Addtionally, the slope is a non-zero value indicating that there is a relationship between the MPG values. 
Lastly, since the p-value was less than 0.05 we can determine that the different prototypes do not have an effect on miles per gallon.
